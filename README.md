# monopoly_py
Hi folks! I aand my friend dev are trying to make monopoly game using Tkinter framework. It is in active development and please feel free to contribute.
The aim is to make a fully functional monopoly game with maximum of 8 players with an approach to make it similar to the actual classic monopoly board game.
Also we are trying to use python- socket programming with threading to make the game on the server and can be played online.
